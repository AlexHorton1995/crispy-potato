Configure tooling

Configure user information for all local repositories
	$ git config --global user.name "[name]" | Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
	$ git config --global user.email "[email address]" | Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
	$ git config --global color.ui auto | Enables helpful colorization of command line output

Branches
Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any commits you make will be made on the branch you're 
currently "checked out" to. Use git status to see which branch that is.

	$ git branch [branch-name] | Creates a new branch
	$ git checkout [branch-name] | Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
	$ git branch -d [branch-name] | Deletes the specified branch

	$ git push | Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
	$ git pull | Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge

Make changes
	$ git add [file] | Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
	$ git commit -m"[descriptive message]" | Records file snapshots permanently in version history
