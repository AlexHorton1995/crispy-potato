    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <br />
        <p>
            To be honest, I don't have a favorite food to prepare. I do enjoy cooking soups, side dishes, and many more things. 
        However, if I absolutely had to pick something that I like to prepare, it 
        would be eggs. If feel like eggs are the easiest thing to cook as long as you
        watch them and don't under or over season them. I have tried to prepare Chicken in
        the Air fryer but it didn't work and I was scared half to death. However the most 
        recent time I made Chicken I put it in the oven and with some secret ingredients (other than Lemon Pepper)
        it was pretty good.

        I like to eat alot of things, so it's hard to choose. I have many favorites like
        <ol>
            <li>Dad and Grandpa's barbeque</li>
            <li>Mom's Chicken Pot Pie and Alfredo</li>
            <li>Dad's Mac and Cheese</li>
        </ol>
         Another food that I like to eat which is my number 1 out of my number ones is Hu Hot. My family knows that I'm 
        crazy over Hu Hot. Even if you mention it after church on a Sunday I'll be the first
        agree with you. The reason I like Hu Hot is because you get to make it your way,
         you get to prepare it, and watch them cook it in front of you. It's heavenly 
        to the soul!

        Some food that is on my bucket list are Cinnamon Rolls made from scratch. I feel like
        it would be something out of my range. When I bake or make something, it is usally in the
        oven or on the stove. Another thing that I would love to make is Mac and Cheese because again, it is one of the things 
        that I like to eat. For me it really does feel that if I gave it a shot it would be an accomplishment, especially for me as a young cook and want to be Chef.
