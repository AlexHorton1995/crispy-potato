        Your first assignment is to create 3 paragraphs below.  Each paragraph 
        <strong>must</strong> have proper punctuation, proper spelling and grammar, and must make 
        sense. Stick to the topic that is chosen for you, and keep it appropriate.<br />
        <br />
        The paragraph must be created using the proper HTML tags.  Be creative with the HTML -
         if you want to use styles, feel free!

        <br />
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

            To be honest I don't have a favorite food to prepare I do enjoy cooking 
        soups and side dishes like corn and carrots you know just those starter dishes. 
        However if I had to absolutely had to pick something that i like to prepare it 
        would be eggs. If feel like eggs are the easiest thing to cook as long as you
        watch them and don't under or over season them. I have tried to prepare Chicken in
        the Air fryer but it didn't work and I was scared half to death. However the most 
        recent time I made Chicken I put it in the oven and with some secret ingredients (other than Lemon Pepper)
        it was pretty good. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My favorite thing to eat is alot of things. I have many favorites like 
        my Dad's and my Grandpa's barbeque when my Mom cook's Chicken Pot Pie or Alfredo
        and when my Dad makes Homemade Mac and Cheese not from the box because then it'
        not Homemade with a rue and all of the goodness. Another food that I like to eat 
        which is my number 1 out of my number ones is Hu Hot. My family knows that I'm 
        crazy over Hu hot. Even if you mention it after church on a Sunday I'll be the first
        agree with you. the reason I like Hu Hot is because you get to make it your way
        and you get to prepare it then watch them cook it in front of you and it id heavenly 
        to the soul.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Some food that is on my bucket list is Cinnamon Rolls made from scratch. I feel like
        it would be something out of my range because if I bake something it is usally in the
        oven and I don't use yeast or a bread maker or any fancy Cinnamon Roll making iteams
        so it would definitely feel like a struggle for me. Another thing that I would love to
        make is Mac and Cheese because again it is one of the things that I like to eat. So for
        me it really do feel that if i give it a shot it would be an accomplishment for me especially
        me as a young cook and want to be Chef.
