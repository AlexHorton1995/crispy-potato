    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
        Your first assignment is to create 3 paragraphs below.  Each paragraph 
        <strong>must</strong> have proper punctuation, proper spelling and grammar, and must make 
        sense. Stick to the topic that is chosen for you, and keep it appropriate.<br />
        <br />
        The paragraph must be created using the proper HTML tags.  Be creative with the HTML -
         if you want to use styles, feel free!  
    </p>

        The subject for today's assignment will be <strong>cooking</strong>. Specific topics are: 
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Favorite food to prepare?</li>
            <li>Favorite food to eat?</li>
            <li>Food that is on your bucket list to prepare (what food do you most desire to try to cook)?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have completed your paragraphs, save your work and check it into the repository.        
        <strong>Create a seperate branch</strong> for the work.  If you need help, ask.
